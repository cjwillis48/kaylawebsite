        <h2>Telehealth</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to office-based services, Renteria Counseling Services also provided telehealth services.
            Telehealth is a way to receive secure, quality mental health counseling services remotely. Please note that
            due to licensing restrictions, Renteria Counseling Services can only offer telehealth to clients physically
            located in the states of Indiana or Kentucky.
            For many people, this increases access to therapy and eliminates barriers to receiving mental health care.
            Often, clients find the convenience of telehealth makes services more obtainable with life's busy schedules.
            Telehealth is secure. Renteria Counseling Services uses Simple Practice, a HIPAA compliant audio/video
            platform, to connect with clients remotely.
            Often, clients have questions about the efficacy of telehealth. Research shows that for most clinical
            presentations, telehealth is just as effective as traditional, in-person services. Many treatment modalities
            can be applied to telehealth with great success. However, some clients will not be appropriate for
            telehealth. If you are interested in telehealth services, an assessment will be completed to ensure that you
            can safely and effectively receive counseling services remotely.
            There is necessary equipment for telehealth. To view these requirements, and for quick tips to prepare you
